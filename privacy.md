Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 12/6/2024

Welcome to Memos AI (“we,” “our,” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Memos AI (the “App”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our services.

1. Scope of This Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to Memos AI, accessible through mobile platforms. By using the App, you agree to the terms described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

2. No Personal Data Collection
Memos AI does not collect, store, or process any personal information from you. Your memos, notes, and other user-generated content remain on your device and are not transmitted to our servers. The App operates locally on your device, and we do not have access to or store the content you create within the App.

3. Google Analytics for Firebase
We use Google Analytics for Firebase to help us understand how users interact with the App. This service may automatically collect certain non-personal information, such as:

Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)
Usage data (e.g., frequency of app use, features accessed)
General location data (e.g., country-level location)
No personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or address) is collected through Google Analytics for Firebase. The data we receive is only used to improve the user experience, diagnose technical issues, and enhance the performance of the App.

For more information on how Google handles the data it collects, please review the Google Privacy Policy and Google Analytics for Firebase Terms.

4. Data Storage and Security
As Memos AI does not send your data to external servers, your notes and memos remain on your own device. We recommend you secure your device with appropriate measures (e.g., password, biometric authentication) to prevent unauthorized access.

5. International Users
Memos AI is available worldwide. By using the App, you understand and acknowledge that Google Analytics for Firebase may process non-personal usage data in the United States or other countries where Google’s servers are located. Google complies with applicable legal frameworks regarding the transfer and processing of data.

6. Children’s Privacy
Memos AI is intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.

7. User Rights and Controls
Since Memos AI does not collect personal data, there is no personal information to request access to, correct, or delete. If you wish to limit analytics tracking, you may do so by adjusting your device settings or following the instructions provided by Google regarding opting out of data collection (e.g., by using Google’s opt-out tools).

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective when we post the revised policy. Your continued use of the App after any modifications indicates that you accept the updated terms.
